Description: Regression and classification trees (e.g. from packages like `partykit` or `rpart`) are a very powerful set of statistical learning algorithms.  
    Nevertheless each tree package has its own way of representing and storing the trees, usually as a nested recursive list with attributes. This makes it very hard to interact with them.  
    This package provides an interface to convert tree objects from various packages into a "tidy" data frame, with a row for each node showing its defining set of rules and its characteristics.
